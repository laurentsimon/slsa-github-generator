# Upload assets

This action uploads assets given a release url. It does not require a tag trigger.
The code is taken from https://github.com/actions/upload-release-asset, but the project is archived.
So we keep a local and updated copy here.

## How to build this action in development
- Install node
- Install typescript
- `npm ci`
- `npm run build`
